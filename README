Install the Canonical userdir-ldap package and configure it for use with
Canonical infra.

The default options should be fine for our normal use.  The only one
you may want to pay attention to is "users-to-migrate", which is a
space-separated list of usernames whose ssh keys will be copied from
~/.ssh/authorized_keys to /etc/ssh/user-authorized_keys.  By default
this is just the ubuntu user, as without this Juju will break, but
if you need to add others, this is the place to do it.
